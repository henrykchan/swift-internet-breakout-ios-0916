### Quick Summary

The Flatiron Company has hired [Insert Your Team Name] agency to build our new super duper Weather application. $$$.  As this is a client oriented application feel free to ask questions of the client to get more context, if needed. 

You will be building a simple weather application using the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/docs/forecast). This application should contain a tab bar controller that shows separate tabs for today's weather, daily forecast and hourly forecast.

Make sure to first read through some of their docs to get a sense as to how to work with their API. Also, you should register an account with them (this is usually a requirement when working with third party API's). [Link](https://darksky.net/dev/register) to register an account.



### Instructions

This lab requires you to use your prior knowledge on using the internet and calling APIs. 

Be sure to use Postman to query the DarkySky API. 

Create the appropriate classes for the DataStore, APIClient, Forecast etc. A basic version of this application could look like the following but use the opportunity to come up with something unique. This lab is aimed at challenging you to come up with your own solutions.

Focus on the API calls first and then begin working on the UI. 

The API requires you to include latitude and longitude. We have included the code to do so in the lab already.

### Hint 
Think about using enums in your application to toggle between Daily and Hourly Forecasts
